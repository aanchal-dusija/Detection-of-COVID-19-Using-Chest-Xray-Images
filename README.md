# Detection of COVID-19 Using Chest X-ray Images By Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository is dedicated to the research project "Detection of COVID-19 Using Chest X-ray Images By Convolutional Neural Networks," authored by Aanchal Dusija under the supervision of Suneel Saraswat. This study focuses on the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

## Project Overview
Amid the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient and rapid testing methods are crucial. This project explores an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR testing method by employing Convolutional Neural Networks to detect COVID-19 through chest X-ray images. The study highlights the potential of CNN in medical imaging and diagnostics, providing a faster, cheaper, and less invasive method to detect COVID-19.

## Objectives
1. To develop a CNN model for the accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images.
2. To assess the model's performance and reliability through various metrics.
3. To contribute to the faster and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19, aiding in the global effort to control the spread of the virus.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: The dataset includes chest X-ray images from both COVID-19 positive patients and normal individuals, collected from public sources such as GitHub and Kaggle.
2. CNN Model Development: Implementation of a CNN model using Python and TensorFlow. The model structure involves convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers designed to process and classify the images.
3. Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and related statistical measures to determine accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

## Key Findings
1. The CNN model achieved a high accuracy rate of 97% in differentiating between COVID-19 and normal chest X-ray images.
2. The model demonstrates the viability of using deep learning and medical imaging for rapid and effective detection of COVID-19.
3. The study emphasizes the importance of further research and larger datasets for continued improvement and validation of the model.

## Repository Contents
1. Research Paper: Full documentation of the project, including the introduction, literature review, methodology, data analysis, and conclusion.
2. Dataset: Links to the public datasets used for training and testing the model.
3. Code: Python notebooks containing the CNN model, training scripts, and evaluation procedures.

## Limitations and Future Scope
